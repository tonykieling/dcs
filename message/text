Debt Collection System (DCS)

- What is the system?
It is a plataform to automated conversation between a debt collector and debtors.

- How does it work?
1 - There is a manual (now) process which triggers a function that sends SMS for all debtors
2 - The debtors answer the message to Twilio
3 - Twilio sends the answer to the Server
4 - The server processes the messages
5 - Back and Forth

Debtor(SMS) => Twilio => Server => Twilio => Debtor

- System's parts (now)
1 - Database that holds all debtors information (debtors data)
2 - Server that send, receive and process the messages (when the conversation flow happens)
3 - Twilio is the SMS sender - all SMS messages will pass through it
4 - Debtor's phone is the device they use to receive/send message to the system (DCS)
